Cathode-Redox
=============

Automatically evaluate crystalline structures from online database and download relevant .cif files.  


The goal of this project is to combine together and improve upon my various scripts to download
crystalline structures from the Crystallography Open Database (COD), http://www.crystallography.net. 

The web server offers an SQL-based API, allowing automated queries and downloads of "cif" files, 
which contain crystallographic information.  

Initially, this project will explore all chemical formulas containing certain user-defined
keys, discard disordered structures, evaluate the theoretical capacity of a compound as an
intercalation cathode, and provide facilities to (massive) download all relevant files.
